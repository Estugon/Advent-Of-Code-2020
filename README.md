# Advent-Of-Code-2020

My solutions for Advent of Code 2020.
Don't know if I have the time to do every task, but I'll try it I guess.
I'll sometimes change up programming languages (and themes) and list them here:

* Day 1: C++ (but goto)
* Day 2: C++
* Day 3: C++ (such diversity, much wow)
* Day 4: Lua (wtf. this was horrible.)
